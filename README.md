# What's does this app do?

EmoFy is a web app that makes use of deep learning to provide users with the best music based on their mood without any hassle.</br>

We made use of different web technologies to build the application along with a custom deep learning model that is running in the background. The model helps in detecting human emotion in real time and using the output that we get i.e. the emotion/mood, we recommend the user songs that they can play using Spotify without even opening the applcation.
