Ever had to spend minutes just to get the right music to get you started with your day? Music that goes with your mood, something to cheer you up when you are not feeling it, something to go with the happy vibes around or just something to calm you down? We got you covered with EmoFy - your perfect work companion to help you get the music for your day.

# What's does this app do?

EmoFy is a web app that makes use of deep learning to provide users with the best music based on their mood without any hassle.</br>

We made use of different web technologies to build the application along with a custom deep learning model that is running in the background. The model helps in detecting human emotion in real time and using the output that we get i.e. the emotion/mood, we recommend the user songs that they can play using Spotify without even opening the applcation.
